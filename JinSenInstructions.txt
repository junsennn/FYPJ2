Hello :) Thank you for wanting to play the rubbish game.
Here are the set of instructions:

1. "W,A,S,D" for player's movement.
2. "Mouse movement" for camera's view.
3. Hold down the left-click button to carry the item.
4. Press the "G" button to unequip the current weapon. Go near the weapon to equip it.
5. If you are using "Z's Gun", press the "left mouse button" to shoot a warp.
You can hold down the "left-click button" to carry multiple items. "Mouse-scroll" to distance
yourself and the items. "Right mouse button" to shoot a ball to disperse the items away.
6. Your objective is to throw away as many rubbish into the bin as fast as possible.
7. Note that there is a time limit, and if you fail to throw the rubbish away, you will be poisoned.

Do give a feedback after you have played the game. Thank you very much, and have fun playing
a rubbish game :D
